## Get Started 🎉

Once you open the app, all you need to do is log in with your Google account and start adding your favorite recipes. You can explore new recipes by clicking on the Load Recipes button or add your own ones if you have your favorites already. Every next time you open the app, you will have your favorite recipes saved there! 😊✅


## Features 📋

- Google Login 🌟
- Managing your own recipes 🤝
- Exploring new recipes 🆕


## About 🚀

Once you log in with your Google account, besides the option of saving and exploring new recipes as well as adding your own ones you will have full control of them. That includes editing, deleting, and changing the name, ingredients, or instructions for the specific recipe to your own liking. It is important to say that if someone is a little suspicious about the app and they do not want to log in with their Google account, they can always try to use the app locally and they will be able to try out the app, but their recipes will be saved just on that device and not on their account since they are not logged in. 😊🤗
